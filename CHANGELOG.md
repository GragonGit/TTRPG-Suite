# Changelog
Welcome to the Changelog. The versioning works as follows:
- `X` is for new major features
- `Y` is for changes to existing features
- `Z` is for bug fixes and minor changes

Changes in the repository not influencing the actual application e.g. Issue Templates do not require a version change.

## 0.1.0 - Setup Nuxt
- Added Nuxt and basic config settings
- Added SASS
- Initialized pages

This is my first time using Nuxt and Vue. Thus, I expect a lot of changes to the config and basically everything else in the first stages of development since I don't know what I want and need yet.

**TTRPG Suite here we come!**
