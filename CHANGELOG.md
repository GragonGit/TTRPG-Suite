# Changelog
Welcome to the Changelog. The versioning works as follows:
- `X` is for new major features
- `Y` is for changes to existing features
- `Z` is for bug fixes and minor changes

Changes in the repository not influencing the actual application e.g. Issue Templates do not require a version change.
