# Changelog
Welcome to the Changelog. The versioning works as follows:
- `X` is for new major features
- `Y` is for changes to existing features
- `Z` is for bug fixes and minor changes

Changes in the repository not influencing the actual application e.g. Issue Templates do not require a version change.

## 0.2.0 - Added Modules
- Added i18n Module - https://nuxt.com/modules/i18n
- Added VueUse Module - https://nuxt.com/modules/vueuse

Two modules that will I likely use a lot. i18n is self-explanatory and VueUse seems to streamline a lot of useful things. I would have added Supabase here as well but it needs further research.

## 0.1.0 - Setup Nuxt
- Added Nuxt and basic config settings
- Added SASS
- Initialized pages

This is my first time using Nuxt and Vue. Thus, I expect a lot of changes to the config and basically everything else in the first stages of development since I don't know what I want and need yet.

**TTRPG Suite here we come!**
